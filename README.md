Toast

Yet another Toast library🍞   
Inspired by [Toast-Swift](https://github.com/scalessec/Toast-Swift), but this one supports multiplatform. That means you can popup Toasts on iOS, tvOS, macOS(OSX), everywhere!

It has yet very limited functionalities yet, so PRs or suggestions are very welcomed!
